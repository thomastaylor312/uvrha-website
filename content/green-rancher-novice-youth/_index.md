## Green Rancher & Novice Youth Standings

## Green Rancher Rules

**The Green Rancher division is reserved for individuals with novice riding and showing experience who wish to learn more about showing in UVRHA at a beginner's pace. New members in UVRHA do not necessarily need to ride in the Green division. Advanced skills may be better suited for one of the other divisions. A Green Rancher must meet all amateur eligibility requirements as well as some additional requirements. See the Rules & Bylaws for more information.**

**A Green Rancher buckle will be awarded when the participant accumulates 150 total points. All points must be accumulated in the Green Rancher Events. The points awarded to the Green Rancher will accumulate and will roll over each year until the rider reaches 150 points. Any points accumulated in any other division will be credited towards the respective division it was won in.**

***Green Rancher Points Accumulation:*** The number of horses to be used for computation shall be those horses actually competing; excluding the number of horses entered but scratched from competition. There shall not be a cap placed on the number of points able to be earned in any one class. A no score or a score of zero will receive 1/2 point in a Green Rancher class for participation.

FOR EXAMPLE: If 20 horses compete in Green Rancher 1st will receive 20 points. 2nd will receive 19 points, 3rd will receive 18 points, etc. Enter as many classes in the Green Rancher division as you like to accumulate points.

Total Number of Points to Graduate the Green Rancher Program is: *150 total points.*

## Novice Youth

**The Novice Youth division will follow a similar format to the Green Rancher division with each participant accumulating points towards winning a buckle. The difference being that a Novice Youth rider will only need to accumulate 50 points in this division. See the Rules & Bylaws for more information.**
