I have been obsessed with horses since I was 12 and had my first experience on a horse, I bought my own horse at 13 and have been hooked ever since. I have tried just about every discipline of riding but love showing in ranch versatility because it makes a very well rounded horse. I also love paddle boarding, pickle ball, and doing anything outside with my 2 girls, 2 dogs and husband. I am passionate about the URVHA because of the amazing people that participate and run the club, member input, and I love getting to show in the best places in Utah!

Growing up showing reiners and reined cowhorse and then moving to Utah, I saw a real need for an association that provided a beginner friendly format for people to show a horse that maybe didn't quite fit the traditional cow horse or the traditional reiner but was still very talented. Thus, with the help of a small village, the UVRHA was born. I am so excited to grow this association and introduce many more people to the Versatility Events. I enjoy spending time with my amazing three kids and hubby and of course showing a super well broke versatility horse!

My name is Micki Musick, I grew up competing in FFA, 4-H, and high school rodeo. I love rodeo and have been involved in almost every aspect of competitionâ€¦. including barrel racing, pole bending, breakaway, and goat tying. I also competed in the National Barrel Horse Association where I was an NBHA World Finals Qualifier. At the age of 16 I competed in my first rodeo queen pageant and quickly fell in love. I went on to hold many rodeo queen titles such as The Lehi RoundUp Rodeo Queen, Strawberries Days Rodeo Queen, Fiesta Days Royalty, Miss Rodeo Old Fort Days, and Miss Rodeo Arkansas.

During my time in Arkansas I also served on the WestArk Horse Show Board, Miss Rodeo NFC Director, NFC IPRA Rodeo Board Member, Old Fort Days PRCA Rodeo Board, and I was the National Clinic Director for the Miss Rodeo USA Pageant.

Now back in Utah I ride and show in the Ranch Versatility as well as serving as the social media director for the Utah Versatility Ranch Horse Association. I am very excited to serve on the UVRHA Board.

Nicole has dreamed of being a horse girl since she could walk! With a little help from her mom and a Groupon, she was able to make that dream a reality after she graduated from college and got a big girl job. Nicole decided to purchase Van (her very first horse) after she gave up on dating. She met her husband shortly after. Nicole works for tech company Autodesk and helps construction folks improve their workflows and efficiency through the use of technology. She brings these skills to the UVRHA by serving as the board secretary.
